<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a self-driven learner with a strong interest in technology, design, and entrepreneurship. After exploring various fields, I realized my passion lies in building digital solutions that solve real-world problems. Though I don’t come from a traditional academic background, Ive chosen a hands-on, practical path to learn and grow—working every day to build a career grounded in creativity, discipline, and impact.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m developing my skills in web development, UI/UX design, and digital marketing. I believe that combining design thinking with strong technical foundations can lead to powerful products. Alongside coding, I’m also learning about business fundamentals, user experience, and product strategy—preparing myself to contribute meaningfully to tech projects and eventually launch my own startup.</p>

<p>My goal is to build technology that’s not only functional but also meaningful. I value curiosity, consistency, and collaboration. Whether it's learning a new tool, designing an intuitive interface, or brainstorming startup ideas with like-minded individuals, I'm always seeking growth. This portfolio reflects my journey so far—and I’m just getting started.</p>
